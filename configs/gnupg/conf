# For the most part, GnuPG uses sane defaults, so not many things need
# to be set.  I like to make sure that UTF-8 is being used, take advantage
# of TOFU's conflict resolution, and I leave some options at the bottom that
# I may enable occasionally.

# Trust model
## TOFU+PGP allows me to use the standard Web of Trust model of PGP while
## using TOFU's conflict detection algorithm.  Settings TOFU's default policy
## to unknown won't assign a positive trust to a binding.
